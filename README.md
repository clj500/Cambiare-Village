# Cambiare Village

Strange things have been happening in Cambiare Village and it's up to you to help protect the village!
Play as a villager and take on unique quests to protect the village from monsters and turn things back to normal.

Navigating the Village:
- Walk using the arrow keys on the keyboard, jump using space.
- Collect change around the village and during quests to trade with villagers for special items.
- Play at your own pace, but enjoy watching the day change.
- Days are measured as 3 minutes real-time
